# Hey, I'm Iqbal 👋

Self-taught developer with 2+ year of experience, passionate about the JavaScript & TypeScript ecosystem — and currently exploring Rust.

I enjoy vibe coding: building things by feel, iterating fast, and learning as I go.

## How I Learn

No bootcamp, no courses — just curiosity, documentation.
I believe the best way to learn is to build, break, and rebuild.

## Why JS/TS?

JavaScript lets me build anywhere — frontend, backend, tooling. TypeScript makes it sane.
And Rust? Because sometimes you want to go closer to the metal.
